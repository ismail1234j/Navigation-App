# Readme
A Windows app I've made for fun. I've tried here to make an ui that resembles a cars navigation system. It does have some features such as:

- Opening Android Auto (Planning to change the current implamentation)
- Turning off the screen
- Controling Volume (Nearly there)

Maybe I'll get it running on a windows mini pc (Atom based?) but for now im only coding for fun.
